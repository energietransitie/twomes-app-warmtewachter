# Twomes WarmteWachter

This repository contains the source code for the WarmteWachter App for both Android and iOS. The WarmteWachter app helps a user to install and connect one or more Twomes measurement devices in his home and to start, monitor and stop acquisition of monitoring data related to the heating of his/her home.

## General info
The app is meant to be installed automatically by clicking on e-mail invitation on your smartphone that contains a Firebase Dynamic Link, which automatically selects the proper app from the proper app store, installs it and activates the user's account using the account activation token in the Firebase Dynamic Link. The user is then asked to proceed by scanning, one-by-one, the QR-code that is attached to each Twomes measurement device that has been sent to the home address of the user. For each device scanned, the proper device installation instructions are retrieved from the Twomes server and presented. The app then connects with the device, which then scans for available Wi-Fi networks. The user is asked to select their home Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks and supply the password for that network. If everything has been entered correctly, the user is notified the setup was complete and succesful and can choose to configure the next device.

## Prerequisites
To deploy and sucessfully use the WarmteWachter app you need to have received an e-mail with a proper Firebase Dynamic Link and you need be in the possession of at least one Twomes measurment device.

## Deploying
As we are currently stil in development, to get an (internal) beta tester version, you need to contact us using the following emailaddress; `marco.prins@windesheim.nl`. Please include the Apple ID or Google Account that's being used on the device you wish to install the WarmteWachter app.

Eventually the production version of the app will be downloaded and installed directly from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store after clicking the Firebase Dynamic Link on your iPhone or Android smartphone, respectively.

## Developing
For getting started with the development of the WarmteWachter app see [Developing - Getting Started](./docs/developing.md).

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development. Ready:

- [x] activate your account using a Firebase Dynamic Link;
- [x] scan the QR code of any of a Twomes measurment device;
- [x] connect via BLE to a Twomes measurement device to provision internet connectivity via your home Wi-Fi network.

To-do:

- [ ] present device specific 'Installation Instructions' that have been fetched from the Twomes backoffice server;
- [ ] connect via SoftAP to a Twomes measurement device to provision internet connectivity via your home Wi-Fi network;
- [ ] verify cuccesful device provisioning with the Twomes backoffice server;
- [ ] more complete non-happy flow coverage;
- [ ] usability improvements.
